Alexandria: A book App with a barcode scanner integrated And Football Score:  A sport App to show match fixtures and scores

Few things I have done in this project:

## Alexandria:
- Integrating the barcode scanner inside an App. In this case I used Zxing API
- Better approach of Navivation Drawer with NavigationView and headerView
- Replaced ListViews by RecyclerViews.
- Integrated broadcast receiver to communicate with the barcodeScaner Activity.

## Football Scores

- Sync Adapter
- Widgets
- Collection Widgets
- Store the API Key in the build.gradle
